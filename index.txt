About me

I'm a SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) at VMware. I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies and domains. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems. I'm currently into SRE-Storage and working on my Data Structures and Algorithms. I'm a tech enthusiast and an active contributor to the developer community.

My job is to ensure that the VMware Cloud Services Platform is available,
reliable, and fast for our customers. I work with a team of engineers to
ensure that our services are designed and implemented to the highest standards.
I also work with our product teams to ensure that the platform is designed to
be easy to deploy and maintain.
